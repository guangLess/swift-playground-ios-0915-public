# Swift â€” Playground

## Objectives

## Playgrounds

With Swift, Xcode introduces a new tool called Playgrounds. These are single files that are continuously scanned and compiled, providing a way to test code snippets without the bulk of an entire Xcode project. They are a great tool for practicing Swift syntax and we suggest you use this one (or another one of your making) when moving forward with these lessons.

Playgrounds allow developers to experience compiler warnings and issues without running in the simulator. Playgrounds also handily show a preview of each line's ending value, allowing a developer to introspect the progression of the code without printing every single line. They are a very handy learning tool.

Unfortunately, playgrounds cannot support testing suites so after this one Playground the lessons will rely upon full projects that include test files.

## Instructions

Open the Playground included in this repository named `swift-playground.playground`. Xcode is the default application for Playgrounds.

You should be met with Apple's default Playground code, a `var str` which is set to `"Hello, Playground"`.
